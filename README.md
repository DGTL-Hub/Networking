Ethernet: This is one of the most common wired networking technologies, and it's used for local area networks (LANs) and data center networking.
Wi-Fi (Wireless LAN): Wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to a network without physical cables.
Fiber Optics: High-speed data transmission technology using optical fibers. It's used for long-distance networking, high-speed internet, and data center interconnects.
Virtual Private Network (VPN): A technology that allows secure communication over untrusted networks like the internet. It's often used for remote access and secure connections between sites.
Software-Defined Networking (SDN): A network architecture that uses software-based controllers to manage and configure the network, providing flexibility and automation.
Network Function Virtualization (NFV): The virtualization of network services traditionally performed by hardware appliances, offering increased flexibility and scalability.
Cloud Networking: Networking solutions provided by cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, allowing you to build and manage networks in the cloud.
Internet of Things (IoT) Networking: Specialized networking technologies designed for connecting IoT devices and sensors, such as LoRaWAN and NB-IoT.
Blockchain-based Networking: Emerging technologies that leverage blockchain for secure and decentralized networking, particularly in scenarios like decentralized applications (DApps).
Mesh Networking: A decentralized networking topology where devices connect to each other to relay data. It's often used in scenarios where traditional infrastructure is unavailable.
5G Networking: The fifth generation of mobile networking technology, offering faster speeds and lower latency, suitable for a wide range of applications, including IoT and mobile broadband.
